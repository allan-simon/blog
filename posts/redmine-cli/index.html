  <h1>Redmine-cli and redmine API</h1>
  <span class="post-date">Wed, Feb 25, 2015</span>
      

<p>I found a tool to manage redmine from the cli, in python:</p>

<p><code>pip install redmine-cli</code></p>

<p>then a config file <code>~/.redmine-cli</code></p>

<pre><code>[default]
key=API_KEY_YOU_CAN_SEE_IN_YOUR_ACCOUNT_ON_REDMINE
my_id=ID_YOU_CAN_ON_YOUR_PROFILE_PAGE
root_url=HOME_PAGE_OF_REDMINE
</code></pre>

<p>then you can do</p>

<ol>
<li><code>redmine open 123</code> to open the issue 123 in your browser</li>
<li><code>redmine issues</code> to see your issues</li>
<li><code>redmine issue 123</code> to see information about issue 123</li>
</ol>

<p>(it has more options I let you check the doc)</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/yanjost/redmine-cli">original repo</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/allan-simon/redmine-cli">my fork where I have some features (like updating a ticket</a></li>
</ul>

<p>(hopefully my modification are in PR on the original repo and will be soon integrated)
my modification include so far:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>redmine issue 123 long</code> to see more detailled information about the issue</li>
<li><code>redmine update 123 'in progress'</code> to update the status to <code>in progress</code> (admitting your redmine has this status)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="toc_0">The long story behind:</h3>

<p>As any good Linux user, I love the CLI (no, there&rsquo;s no such thing
as a <strong>good</strong> Linux user who does not love the CLI). Starting from
that, though I appreciate using Redmine to manage features to implement,
bugs etc. I&rsquo;m not really fan of needing to click here and there,
especially when the only things I want is</p>

<ul>
<li>know what a Merge request on gitlab referencing the ticket XXX is about</li>
<li>see what tickets are assigned to me</li>
<li>update a ticket status</li>
</ul>

<p>It becomes even less practical when you want to update a list of ticket
you can either:</p>

<ol>
<li>select in the list, while keeping shift pressed, the list of ticket you want to update</li>
<li>right click,</li>
<li>update the status</li>
</ol>

<p>The problem of that technique is that, if you click a little too much on the right,
on the left etc. you loose your selection, which can be very frustating
Then you have the second technique</p>

<ol>
<li>click on ticket N</li>
<li>click on update</li>
<li>update, click on submit</li>
</ol>

<p>each of these steps impliying a page load, no need to tell you how much times
it takes even for 5 tickets</p>

<h3 id="toc_1">The CLI will always be there for you: redmine-cli</h3>

<p>For now some month, whenever I&rsquo;m looking for that little tool, the reflex is to
search for it on github. As I knew there was a Redmine API and that we don&rsquo;t have
time for a NIH (Not Invented Here) syndrom, it was very likely such a CLI tool
would already exist.</p>

<p>I found a several tool, <a href="https://github.com/diasjorge/redmine-cli">one in ruby</a>
which seems rather complete, but as it was not updated for 2 years, and I didn&rsquo;t felt
like installing ruby on my computer (I guess it&rsquo;s already install but&hellip;) and it was
late, so losing 2 minutes to know how to install the project was too much</p>

<ul>
<li>ALWAYS PUT CLEAR INSTRUCTION , DUMB PROOF, ON HOW TO INSTALL YOUR TOOL</li>
<li>if a project is &ldquo;complete&rdquo; and its the reason why you&rsquo;re not updating it, state it
so that people know if the project is dead or just &lsquo;in good shape enough but the author is still active&rsquo;</li>
</ul>

<p>So I found the python project, which was updated in 2014 and
had clear installation instruction <code>pip install redmine-cli</code></p>

<h3 id="toc_2">Missing feature: redmine API my love</h3>

<p>while implementing the feature I found that</p>

<ul>
<li>the API call was returning a 200 (without nothing in the body)</li>
<li>BUT the status was not updated (though the ticket was showing activity &lsquo;less than a minute ago&rsquo;)</li>
</ul>

<p>after some research I found <a href="http://www.redmine.org/boards/2/topics/25920">that redmine discussion</a></p>

<ul>
<li>I need to declare the header <code>Application/Json</code> (normal)</li>
<li>It needs to have the <code>status_id</code> value as a string (and I was giving an integer)</li>
</ul>

<p>The second point is raging because GUESS WHAT, that integer was given to me BY REDMINE ITSELF !
So please please when you do an API</p>

<ul>
<li>Be consistent, if <code>status_id</code> is an integer once, it must always be a integer</li>
<li>Have a clear documentation, with example</li>
</ul>
