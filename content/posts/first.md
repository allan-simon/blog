+++
It has been a long time since I last did a blog the biggest reason behind were:

  * it's hard to maintain a server and a blog platform
  * most common web plateforms are blocked in China
  * the other plateforms does not fit my geeky needs
  * non-self hosted platform make it hard to have easy backup of your data

So here we are, after reading comments on HackerNews I've found the project
[Hugo](http://gohugo.io) which permits you to create a static blog the
advantages I see to it

  * it's all command line and simple to install
  * vim and markdown friendly, posting is just one more markdown file
  * can be hosted on github (which solve the hosting problem)
  * it's text files and git (which solve the backup problem)
